i) Definition. "Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by one party ("Discloser") to the other ("Recipient"), directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, which is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation, or learned by Recipient under circumstances in which such information would reasonably be understood to be confidential. Confidential Information may include information disclosed in confidence to Discloser by third parties. For the purposes of this Agreement, the Licensed Products, the results of any performance, functional or other evaluation of the Licensed Products shall be deemed Confidential Information of Rapid-I.
ii) Exceptions. The confidentiality obligations in this Section 9 shall not apply with respect to any of the Discloser's Confidential information which Recipient can demonstrate: (a) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to Recipient or has become in the public domain through no act or omission of Recipient; (b) was known to Recipient, without restriction, at the time of disclosure as shown by the files of Recipient in existence at the time of disclosure; (c) was disclosed by Recipient with the prior written approval of Discloser; (d) was independently developed by Recipient without any use of Discloser's Confidential Information by employees or other agents of (or contractors hired by) Recipient who had no access to or did not rely on Discloser's Confidential Information; or (e) became known to Recipient, without restriction, from a source other than Discloser without breach of this Agreement by Recipient and otherwise not in violation of Discloser's rights.
iii) Restrictions on Use and Disclosure. Recipient agrees not to use Discloser's Confidential Information or disclose, distribute or disseminate Discloser's Confidential Information except in furtherance of the performance of its obligations or enforcement of its rights hereunder or as otherwise expressly agreed by Discloser in writing. Recipient agrees to restrict access to such Confidential Information to those employees or consultants of Recipient who need to know such Confidential Information for performing as contemplated hereunder and have agreed in writing to be bound by a confidentiality obligation no less protective than that contained in this Agreement. Recipient shall exercise the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information to others as it takes to preserve and safeguard its own information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care.
iv) Compelled Disclosure. If Recipient is compelled by a court or other competent authority or applicable law to disclose Confidential Information of Discloser, it shall give Discloser prompt written notice and shall provide Discloser with reasonable cooperation at Discloser's expense so that Discloser may take steps to oppose such disclosure or obtain a restraining order. Recipient shall not be in breach of its obligations in this Section 9 if it makes any legally compelled disclosure provided that Recipient meets the foregoing notice and cooperation requirements.
v) Injunctive Relief. Recipient acknowledges that breach of the confidentiality obligations would cause irreparable harm to Discloser, the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, Recipient agrees that Discloser is entitled to immediate injunctive relief in the event of breach of an obligation of confidentiality by Recipient, and that Discloser shall not be required to post a bond or show irreparable harm in order to obtain such injunctive relief.
vi) Return of Confidential Information. As between the parties, Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Discloser. At any time, upon Discloser's reasonable request, Recipient shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days) return to Discloser or destroy, at the election of the Discloser, any Confidential Information of the Discloser. In addition, within 30 days after termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall (i) promptly return all tangible materials containing such Confidential Information to Discloser, (ii) remove all Confidential Information (and any copies thereof) from any computer systems of the Recipient, its contractors and its distributors, and confirm in writing that all materials containing Confidential Information have been destroyed or returned to Discloser, as applicable, by Recipient.

Upon prior notice, Rapid-I or its representative may inspect such records to confirm Customer's compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Prompt adjustments shall be made by Customer as directed by Rapid-I to compensate for any errors or breach discovered by such audit, such as underpayment of the License Fee, with the applicable late payment interest. Additionally, if Customer has underpaid Rapid-I or its authorized reseller by more than 5% of the total amount owed hereunder, the cost of the audit shall be borne by Customer.

17. Export Restrictions. Customer understands that the Licensed Products contain encryption technology and other software programs that may require an export license from the U.S. State Department and that export or re-export of the Licensed Products to certain entities (such as a foreign government and its subdivisions) and certain countries is prohibited. Customer acknowledges that it will comply with all applicable export and import control laws and regulations of the United States and the foreign jurisdiction in which the Licensed Products are used and, in particular, Customer will not export or re-export the Licensed Products without all required United States and foreign government licenses. Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Rapid-I and its suppliers and licensors from and against any violation of such laws or regulations by Customer or any of its agents, officers, directors or employees.

18. Waiver.  No waiver under this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by Rapid-I or the Customer against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought.  Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described therein and shall in no way impair the rights of Rapid-I or the Customer granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time.  Any delay or forbearance by Rapid-I in exercising any right hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of that right.

19. Miscellaneous. Rapid-I may freely assign this Agreement to any third party without restriction. Together with any Order Forms, this is the entire agreement between Rapid-I and the Customer relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement (including applicable Order Forms) and the Rapid-I Payment Terms (if applicable) shall control over any additional or different terms of any correspondence, order, confirmation, invoice or similar document, even if accepted in writing by both parties, and waivers and amendments of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only if made by non-preprinted agreements indicating specifically what sections of this Agreement are affected, signed by both parties and clearly understood by both parties to be an amendment or waiver. When a new License Term begins the most current version of this Agreement made available by Rapid-I shall be applicable to Customer's use of the Software.

C. Contractual Partner is Rapid-I GmbH

Section 1 and 2 are exclusively  applicable to Commercial Software. Section 3 is exclusively applicable to Free Software. 

1. Warranty Rapid-I GmbH ensures that the Software will conform to the program descriptions for the time period agreed herein. If a defect is noticed within this time, the defect and its manifestation have to be described in a written letter of complaint exactly enough to enable an examination and repetition of the defect (for example the submission of error messages) and that an operating error can be excluded (for example by reporting the work steps) and send to contact-de@rapidminer.com. In case the letter of complaint is justified, Rapid-I commits to supplementary performance, namely by its own choice either through remedy of the defects or through compensation delivery. Rapid-I can especially execute the supplementary performance by delivering a new program status or by demonstrating the possibilities to avoid the effects of the defect. Customer also has to accept a new program status, if this should in effect mean an acceptable effort of adjustment for you. If the supplementary performance should go wrong or be refused twice within 6 months, Customer is entitled to claim a reduction of the fees or the rescission of the contract. Rapid-I GmbH is entitled to refuse the supplementary performance if the same is only possible at disproportionate costs for Rapid-I GmbH. 

2. Liability Beyond this warranty Rapid-I GmbH is liable during the contract period, but only in cases of intent and gross fault according to the legal regulations, in case of a given guarantee and according to German Product Liability Act. In cases of slight fault Rapid-I GmbH is only liable if an essential contractual obligation (cardinal obligation) is violated, or in the case of default or unenforceability. In case of liability due to slight fault this liability is limited to defects that are predictable or typical. A liability for absence of a guaranteed condition, due to malice, for personal injury, defects of title, or liabilities according to the Product Liability Act and the German Data Protection Act will remain unaffected. In cases of claims against Rapid-I GmbH due to warranty or liability, a contributory negligence by Customer or its authorized individual is to be taken into account appropriately, particularly in cases of insufficient error reports by Customer or Customer's authorized individual or in cases of insufficient data back-up or inappropriate use of data mining models. Insufficient data back-up is especially the case if the user fails to guard by appropriate security means that comply with the state of the art, against external influences, especially against computer viruses and other phenomena that can jeopardize single data or the complete data base.

3. Liability for Free Software The Customer acknowledges that the Software may contain operational malfunctions, errors, or other defects. As the Software may only be used for purposes of evaluating and testing, Customer agrees to use the Software at its own risk to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Rapid-I GmbH will only be liable for in cases of a guarantee, where explicitly labeled as such and in cases of intent or if a defect of the subject matter was fraudulently concealed. Rapid-I GmbH shall not be liable for any damage, unless the causing is meeting the constraints above. Customer acknowledges and agrees that no third party rights are granted or protected under this Agreement. 

The customer acknowledges and agrees that Rapid-I has no obligation under this Agreement to correct any defects or errors in the Software furnished to customer under this Agreement, regardless of whether customer informs Rapid-I of such defects or errors or Rapid-I otherwise becomes aware of such defects or errors. In addition, Rapid-I has no obligation under this Agreement to provide support to the Licensee. Any support obligations would be pursuant to a separate support agreement between the parties. 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis of this Agreement, and that, absent any of such disclaimers, exclusions or limitations of liability, the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms, would be substantially different.
